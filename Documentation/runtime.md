In short, the Dolittle Runtime manages the connections from the SDK's and from other Runtimes to the [Event Store](). It's the backend of our system.

It's called the Runtime as it's what runs and powers the SDK's to do their job.

### Technicalities

The connection between the Runtime and the SDK's is managed through [gRPC]() call's

[Event Store]() is blah blah
